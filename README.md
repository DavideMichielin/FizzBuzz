# First Documentation for assignment

We want to write a Java program that prints the numbers from 1 to 100 to the "standard" output stream and follows these rules.

   - For multiples of 3 it prints Fizz instead of the number.
   - For multiples of 5 it prints Buzz instead of the number.
   - For numbers which are multiples of both 3 and 5 it prints FizzBuzz.

We want our Java program to print numbers from 1 to 105 and apply these additional rules.

   -For multiples of 7 it prints Bang instead of the number.
   -For numbers which are multiples of both 3 and 7 it prints FizzBang.
   -For numbers which are multiples of both 5 and 7 it prints BuzzBang.
   -For numbers which are multiples of 3, 5 and 7 it prints FizzBuzzBang.
